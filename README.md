The project uses MockApi : A mock API server imitates a real API server by providing realistic responses to requests.
Project performs CRUD Operations: C=> Creating new task R:> Reading or Getting task stored, U=> Updating the task according to you,
 D=> Deleting the task after Completion 
To fetch data from mockAPI I have used axios : 
Axios is a promise-based HTTP library that lets developers make requests to either their own or a third-party server to fetch data.
It offers different ways of making request such as GET, POST , PUT and DELETE.

React Hooks: useState=> Used To Track State in our functional component, useEffect => Used to Fetch Data.

User Can simply create a task and later update it according to the  requirement and delete it also.

The Project simply demonstrate my ability to use Reactjs Library to build a single page application,
Also, to perform CRUD Operations on the API endpoint.
